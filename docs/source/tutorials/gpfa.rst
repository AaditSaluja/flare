Training a Gaussian Process from an AIMD Run 
===============================================
Steven Torrisi (torrisi@g.harvard.edu), December 2019

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how a previously existing Ab-Initio 
Molecular  Dynamics (AIMD) trajectory can be used to train a Gaussian Process model.

We can use a very short trajectory for a very simple molecule which is already 
included in the test files in order to demonstrate how to set up and run the code.
The trajectory this tutorial focuses on  involves a few frames of the 
molecule Methanol vibrating about it's equilibrium configuration, ran in VASP.
