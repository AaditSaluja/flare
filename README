FLARE (Fast Learning of Atomistic Rare Events)

The website for this code is:
https://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu/flare


PRE-REQUISITES:
1. Have a working installation of Quantum ESPRESSO on your machine. The instructions for installation can be found here: https://www.quantum-espresso.org/
2. You must have the Python package numba installed on your machine. If using Anaconda, you can get it with the command "conda install numba".
3. In order for unit testing to work,
   a. set an environment variable called "PWSCF_COMMAND" to point to your pw.x Quantum ESPRESSO binary.
   b. ensure you have the pytest python package installed.
4. Add the flare directory to your Python path.

UNIT TESTS:
We recommend running unit tests to validate that you can run FLARE on your machine. We have implemented our tests using the pytest suite. 
You can call 'pytest' from the command line in the tests directory to validate that you can call Quantum ESPRESSO and that your Numba installation is being correctly used by FLARE.
